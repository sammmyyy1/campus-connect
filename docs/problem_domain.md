# Problem Domain Description

## Background
On college campuses, student participation in events plays an important role in building community, encouraging involvement, and improving the overall student experience. However, many students remain unaware of upcoming events or find it difficult to keep track of activities organized by different departments and student groups.

## Problem
Currently, there is no single, centralized platform for students to discover and manage campus events. Information about events is scattered across flyers, emails, and social media, which often leads to:
- Low student awareness
- Poor event turnout
- Difficulty for event organizers to communicate updates
- Lack of feedback mechanisms to improve future events

## Proposed Solution
**Campus Connect** is a full-stack **web-based information system** that provides a centralized platform for student event engagement. The system allows:
- **Students** to browse events, RSVP, and provide feedback.
- **Event organizers** to create and update event listings.
- **Admins** to manage users, events, and system notifications.

## Objectives
1. Increase student awareness of campus events.  
2. Simplify the process of RSVPing and attending events.  
3. Provide feedback tools for students to share their experiences.  
4. Give event organizers and admins better tools to manage events and track participation.  

## Target Users
- **Students:** Discover and attend events.  
- **Event Organizers:** Post and manage events.  
- **Admins:** Oversee system operations, notifications, and user management.  

## Goals
The primary goal of Campus Connect is to **boost student engagement** by streamlining event discovery, participation, and communication between students, organizers, and administrators.
